- 👋 Hi, I’m Bill Helton, handle: @williamhelton3
- 👀 I’m interested in helping others learn, mental health, and how software can help bridge these.
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning my coding skills after a hiatis for my personal health after an injury.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile projects geared towards helping people track their mental health for use in their personal lives, their families to help them
- understand the challenges they face, and for use in with their doctors to see short and long term trends.
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached here, or on linkedin.com:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-helton/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love hiking, nature, and ballroom dancing.  (Irony, my wife can't dance!)
